And who goes there, who goes there,

In that vast and mighty throng?

— The Belarusians.


And what do they bear on their weary backs,

On their bloodied hands, in their bark-bound tracks?

— Their sorrow.


And where do they carry that sorrow untold,

Where do they show it, so bitter, so bold?

— To the wide world.


And who was it taught them, millions strong,

To carry their wrong, to awaken from long

Dreams of silence?

— Misery, sorrow.


And what do they seek, what stirs their dream,

They, scorned through ages, the blind, the dumb?

— To be called human.
