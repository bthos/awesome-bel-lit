# Contributing to Awesome Belarusian Literature

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you add translations and new content to the repository.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Translate existing works** into new languages
2. **Add new works** by existing authors
3. **Add new authors** and their works
4. **Improve existing translations**
5. **Fix errors** in metadata or content
6. **Improve documentation**

## Before You Start

1. Check the [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) file to understand the repository organization
2. Look at existing examples in the `authors/` directory
3. Make sure your contribution doesn't duplicate existing content
4. For translations, ensure you have the right to contribute the translation

## Adding a Translation

### Step 1: Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-bel-lit.git
cd awesome-bel-lit
git checkout -b translation/work-name-language-code
```

### Step 2: Find the Work

Navigate to the work you want to translate:
```bash
cd content/authors/{author-id}/works/{work-id}/
```

### Step 3: Create Translation File

Copy the original Belarusian content (Markdown format):
```bash
cp be.md {language-code}.md
```

### Step 4: Translate

Edit the new Markdown file with your translation:
- Update the `language` field in the frontmatter
- Translate the `title` field
- Translate all content (preserve stanza/paragraph structure)
- Add your name to `translator` field
- Add current year to `translation_year` field
- Add cultural notes in frontmatter if needed

Example for poetry:
```markdown
---
language: en
work_id: who-goes-there
author_id: kupala-yanka
title: Who Goes There?
content_type: poem
translator: Your Name
translation_year: 2024
notes:
  - reference: stanza:2
    text: Cultural context about this stanza...
---

Who goes there? Who goes there
In this darkness of night?

— Your own, brother, your own! A Belarusian,
Who sows in the field at night.
```

**Note:** Separate stanzas with blank lines. Keep lines within a stanza on separate lines.

### Step 5: Build JSON Files

Generate JSON files from your Markdown:
```bash
python3 build.py
```

This automatically creates the corresponding `.json` file for API consumption.

### Step 6: Update Metadata

The `available_translations` field is now AUTO-GENERATED by the build script, so you don't need to update metadata.json manually. Just ensure your .md file exists and run the build script.

### Step 7: Test Your Changes

Validate your files:
```bash
# Validate structure and JSON
python3 validate.py
```

### Step 8: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add [language] translation of [work name] by [author]"
git push origin translation/work-name-language-code
```

### Step 8: Create Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Describe your translation
4. Submit for review

## Adding a New Work

### Step 1: Create Work Directory

```bash
mkdir -p content/authors/{author-id}/works/{work-id}
```

### Step 2: Create Metadata

Create `content/authors/{author-id}/works/{work-id}/metadata.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "work-id",
  "author_id": "author-id",
  "type": "poem",
  "titles": {
    "be": "Беларуская назва",
    "en": "English title"
  },
  "year_written": 1920,
  "year_published": 1920,
  "original_language": "be",
  "tags": {
    "be": ["паэзія"],
    "en": ["poetry"]
  }
}
```

**Note**: Do NOT include `available_translations` - it's auto-generated by build script.

### Step 3: Add Original Content

Create `content/authors/{author-id}/works/{work-id}/be.md` with the original Belarusian text in Markdown format.

### Step 4: Follow Steps 6-8 from Translation Section

## Adding a New Author

### Step 1: Create Author Directory

```bash
mkdir -p content/authors/{author-id}/works
```

### Step 2: Create Author Info

```json
{
  "id": "author-id",
  "names": {
    "be": "Імя Аўтара",
    "en": "Author Name"
  },
  "biography": {
    "be": "Біяграфія...",
    "en": "Biography..."
  },
  "birth_year": 1900,
